# Changelog

## 1.5.0

-   Removed `position` and `setPosition` public properties.

<summary style="cursor: pointer;">Workarounds and causes</summary>
Now, to get the position, the `onMove` event should be listened, as in the code example below:

```jsx
export default () => {
    const [position, setPosition] = createSignal(0);

    return <Slidy onMove={(e) => setPosition(e.detail.position)} />;
};
```

In previous version the `position` property has no effect, and `setPosition` was used to get the actual position. In such conditions, it is generally not necessary, especially since it slows down the code by calling the signal setting to the current value.
